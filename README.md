# GIMP-Grass-Colorizer-Script
Colorize Textures in GIMP using the same math that Minecraft does. The math is same for all versions 
of Minecraft. Especially handy for making custom grass block textures in MC3DS Edition, as 
each color for the grass side texture is a separate texture.

The script is very bare bones, and straight to the point, so excuse the ugly interface and lack of 
options. Currently only works on 16 x 16 textures.
